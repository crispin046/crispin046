👋 Hi, I’m @crispin046
I'm Crispin Oigara, a data science and analytics enthusiast currently pursuing my studies at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology Karen Campus. I'm fascinated by how data can tell powerful stories and reveal insights that drive better decisions. My goal is to become a well-rounded data scientist, capable of leveraging data to solve complex challenges in diverse fields.

👀 I’m interested in data science and analytics
My interests span various areas within data science and analytics, including data visualization, machine learning, predictive modeling, and statistical analysis. I’m especially drawn to projects that require transforming raw data into actionable insights, designing dashboards, and automating workflows. Additionally, I'm intrigued by natural language processing (NLP) and how AI can be used to make data more accessible and useful.

🌱 I’m currently learning Power BI
As part of my journey to become a skilled data analyst, I’m focusing on Power BI, a powerful tool for creating interactive dashboards and reports. I’m learning how to connect, transform, and model data in Power BI to build insightful visualizations that can help drive strategic decisions. This complements my skills in other tools like Python and SQL, allowing me to provide end-to-end data solutions.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven projects, data visualization, and analytics initiatives
I’m open to working on projects that involve data exploration, analysis, and visualization. I would love to collaborate with others to create impactful data stories, analyze trends, and develop machine learning models. If you have a project that requires digging into data, finding patterns, and telling its story visually, I’d be excited to team up. I also enjoy combining my skills in data science with content creation, so I’m open to projects that need a creative edge.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy exploring nature and discovering new places!
When I’m not working with data, you’ll likely find me outdoors, enjoying the beauty of nature and traveling to new destinations. I believe that exploring diverse environments inspires creativity and brings fresh perspectives to my work.
